\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we developed a mathematical model to predict the spread of dandelions and evaluate whether they are genuinely invasive. Our seed agent model considers the different phases of a dandelion's life cycle, including seed dispersal, germination, plant development, and the puffball stage. The model also considers environmental factors such as temperature, light, and nutrients. The paper discusses the application of the model to three different regions and analyzes the ecological impact and economic potential of other invasive species.

To evaluate foreign species' trade-offs, we formulate an impact score based on ecological and economic factors. Furthermore, our model is adaptable as we provide a unique framework for different regions and foreign plant combinations.
