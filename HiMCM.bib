Highest yields were obtained if the nitrogen that would have been applied at planting time was applied at the 5-leaf stage in addition to the N that would normally be applied at this time. If the preplant N application is skipped, the crop nitrogen status must be monitored carefully and N fertilizer should be applied by the 5-leaf stage to avoid a yield reduction. If a large amount of N is applied at the 5-leaf stage, lodging may be encouraged.},

Correlation coefficients were determined among these properties after grouping the soils according to cultural practice and soil texture. The average organic matter and total N content of Florida mineral soils were 2.52 and 0.060\%, respectively. Nitrate produced in 2 and 6 weeks of incubation averaged 21 and 42 ppm., respectively. All three of these constituents increased with increases in fineness of soil texture. Cultural practices also had an influence on these properties. In general, a highly significant relationship was found between total N and organic matter, and total N and nitrate production. However, a significant relationship between organic matter and nitrate production occurred only for certain of the cultural and textural groups with a higher degree of correlation at the end of 6 weeks than at the end of 2 weeks.},

	abstract = {Dandelion seeds can be elegantly released by a gentle wind, but their separating mechanism has not been revealed. Here, we investigated the separating mechanism via structure observation, model analysis and separation force measurement. Connecting region of a dandelion seed includes barbs distributed on the inserting region of achene and groove of the inflorescence head. The barbs have conical morphology with a length of 42–50 μm, and the groove has plenty of wrinkles to enhance its wrapping ability. Based on structure characteristics of the connecting region, we established a model to analyze the mechanical properties produced by barbs and wrinkles during their separation. Model result confirmed that the barbs in different part of the inserting region have considerable difference in degree of separation difficulty, and the calculated separation force decreases sharply when the separation angle increases from 20° to 80°. The measured separation force (10.67–0.35 mN) showed almost the same change tendency as the calculated separation force, confirming the validity of our established model. Our study reveals the separating mechanism of dandelion seeds, and provides an approach for the biomimetic design of controllable attachment/release device used in the field of mechanical engineering.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel swarm intelligence bioinspired optimization algorithm, called the Dandelion Optimizer (DO), for solving continuous optimization problems. DO simulates the process of dandelion seed long-distance flight relying on wind, which is divided into three stages. In the rising stage, seeds raise in a spiral manner due to the eddies from above or drift locally in communities according to different weather conditions. In the descending stage, flying seeds steadily descend by constantly adjusting their direction in global space. In the landing stage, seeds land in randomly selected positions so that they grow. The moving trajectory of a seed in the descending stage and landing stage are described by Brownian motion and a Levy random walk. CEC2017 benchmark functions are utilized to evaluate the performance of DO, including the optimization accuracy, stability, convergence, and scalability, through a comparison with 9 well-known nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms. Finally, the applicability of DO is verified by solving 4 real-world optimization problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed DO method is a higher performing optimizer with outstanding iterative optimization and strong robustness compared with well-established algorithms. Source codes of DO are publicly available at https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/114680-dandelion-optimizer.},

Weber ex Wiggers (dandelion, pissenlit officinal) is a perennial weed occurring in parks, gardens, pastures, orchards, roadsides, vegetable gardens, agricultural crops and horticultural crops. A common weed worldwide, it was originally introduced from Eurasia and now occurs in every province of Canada. It is an aesthetic problem during flowering and seed production, interrupting turfgrass uniformity and density; it reduces yields of agricultural crops; it causes slower drying of hay; its pollen is allergenic; and it acts as an alternative host for several pests and diseases. A number of herbicides are available for its control. Mechanical removal of T. officinale plants has limited success, due to the regenerative capacity of the long taproot. Insects, fungi, sheep and geese have been considered as biological control agents for dandelion. Key words: Taraxacum officinale, dandelion, weed biology, Canada.},

This highlights the importance of designing policies that can mitigate the impacts of these disasters on the economy and society. A rapidly expanding literature has estimated the direct (e.g., property damage) and indirect (e.g., gross domestic product growth, trade) economic impacts of natural disasters. This article reviews this emerging literature. We synthesize the main theoretical, computational, and empirical methods used, summarize key findings on the economic impacts of natural disasters, and discuss factors that have been found to mitigate disaster impacts.
