	abstract = {The results of this study support the practice of not applying nitrogen at planting time even if the soil N level is low. Highest yields were obtained if the nitrogen that would have been applied at planting time was applied at the 5-leaf stage in addition to the N that would normally be applied at this time. If the preplant N application is skipped, the crop nitrogen status must be monitored carefully and N fertilizer should be applied by the 5-leaf stage to avoid a yield reduction. If a large amount of N is applied at the 5-leaf stage, lodging may be encouraged.},

Correlation coefficients were determined among these properties after grouping the soils according to cultural practice and soil texture. The average organic matter and total N content of Florida mineral soils were 2.52 and 0.060\%, respectively. Nitrate produced in 2 and 6 weeks of incubation averaged 21 and 42 ppm., respectively. All three of these constituents increased with increases in fineness of soil texture. Cultural practices also had an influence on these properties. In general, a highly significant relationship was found between total N and organic matter, and total N and nitrate production. However, a significant relationship between organic matter and nitrate production occurred only for certain of the cultural and textural groups with a higher degree of correlation at the end of 6 weeks than at the end of 2 weeks.},

	abstract = {Dandelion seeds can be elegantly released by a gentle wind, but their separating mechanism has not been revealed. Here, we investigated the separating mechanism via structure observation, model analysis and separation force measurement. Connecting region of a dandelion seed includes barbs distributed on the inserting region of achene and groove of the inflorescence head. The barbs have conical morphology with a length of 42–50 μm, and the groove has plenty of wrinkles to enhance its wrapping ability. Based on structure characteristics of the connecting region, we established a model to analyze the mechanical properties produced by barbs and wrinkles during their separation. Model result confirmed that the barbs in different part of the inserting region have considerable difference in degree of separation difficulty, and the calculated separation force decreases sharply when the separation angle increases from 20° to 80°. The measured separation force (10.67–0.35 mN) showed almost the same change tendency as the calculated separation force, confirming the validity of our established model. Our study reveals the separating mechanism of dandelion seeds, and provides an approach for the biomimetic design of controllable attachment/release device used in the field of mechanical engineering.},
